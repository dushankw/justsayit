# Steps to Create a Firefox Extension for Voice Typing using OpenAI's Whisper API

1. Set up the project structure:
   - Create a main directory for your extension (e.g., "justsayit")
   - Create subdirectories for icons, popup, and options

2. Create the manifest file (manifest.json):
   - Define extension metadata, permissions, and script locations

3. Implement the background script (background.js):
   - Handle recording state
   - Manage API key storage
   - Implement audio transcription using OpenAI's Whisper API

4. Create the popup interface (popup.html and popup.js):
   - Design the user interface for starting/stopping recording
   - Display transcription results
   - Show a list of saved recordings

5. Implement the content script (content.js):
   - Handle audio recording in the active tab
   - Send recorded audio to the background script for transcription

6. Create the options page (options.html and options.js):
   - Allow users to input their OpenAI API key
   - Provide appearance settings (light/dark mode)

7. Design and add extension icons

8. Implement local storage for saving recordings:
   - Use IndexedDB to store audio blobs and transcriptions

9. Add playback functionality for saved recordings

10. Implement error handling and user feedback

11. Test the extension thoroughly:
    - Check all functionalities (recording, transcription, playback)
    - Test in different contexts and websites

12. Prepare for submission:
    - Create a detailed description for the extension
    - Take screenshots of the extension in use
    - Review and ensure compliance with Firefox's policies

13. Submit the extension for review on the Firefox Add-ons site

14. Address any feedback from the review process

15. Publish the extension once approved

Remember to continuously update and maintain your extension based on user feedback and any API changes from OpenAI.
